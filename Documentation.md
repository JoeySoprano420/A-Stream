## A-Stream Syntax Guide

### Variables

Variables are declared using the `let` keyword:
```plaintext
let x = 10;
let name = "Alice";


Functions

fn add(a: int, b: int) -> int {
    return a + b;
}


Control Flow

if (x > 0) {
    print("Positive");
} else {
    print("Negative");
}


Error Handling

try {
    let result = divide(10, 0);
} catch (Exception e) {
    print("Error: " + e.message);
}



#### 16.2 Tutorials and Examples

The documentation will also include tutorials and example projects to help users get started with A-Stream.

##### Example: Beginner Tutorial

```markdown
# A-Stream Beginner Tutorial

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

1. Set up the A-Stream environment
2. Write your first program
3. Handle errors and debug your code
4. Write tests for your functions

## Step 1: Setting Up A-Stream

Follow the instructions to install A-Stream on your machine.

## Step 2: Writing Your First Program

Create a new file `hello.as`:
```plaintext
print("Hello, World!");

Run the program

astream run hello.as


#### 16.3 Advanced Topics

For advanced users, the documentation will include in-depth explanations of more complex features, such as memory management, optimization techniques, and integration with external libraries.

##### Example: Advanced Optimization Techniques

```markdown
# Advanced Optimization in A-Stream

A-Stream offers several built-in optimization techniques to help improve the performance of your programs:

1. **Inlining Functions**: Use the `inline` keyword to reduce function call overhead.
2. **Memory Management**: Understand how to efficiently manage memory with custom allocators.
3. **Cache Optimizations**: Utilize built-in caching mechanisms to reduce redundant calculations.


.gitignore

Breakdown of .gitignore contents:
Build Output Directories: These directories (build/, bin/, etc.) contain generated files that should not be tracked by version control.
Dependency Directories: If you're using external dependencies (e.g., node_modules/ for JavaScript-based tools), ignore them.
Compiled Object Files and Binaries: Temporary or intermediate files generated during the compilation process (e.g., .o, .exe, etc.).
IDE Files: If you use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ, you may want to ignore project-specific files (.vscode/, .idea/).
Logs and Temporary Files: Ignore system-generated logs and backup/temp files.
Python Files: If you use Python scripts for testing or utility purposes, itâ€™s best to ignore Python bytecode files like .pyc.
Package Managers & Environment Variables: Ignore package-lock files or environment variable files that could contain sensitive information.
Additional Customization:
If your project includes specific tools or workflows that generate additional temporary or build files, you can extend this .gitignore accordingly.
